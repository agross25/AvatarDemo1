#AvatarDemo1 App

#App Description
This app is a simple implementation of a semi-interactive avatar. In this case, an emoji is used to represent the avatar. Over time, the avatar grows "hungry", and its hunger bar reflects those changes. As the hunger level increases, the emoji shifts from a smiling face to a frowning face, a further indication to the user that it is time for the avatar to be fed.
The user can use the "Feed" button to reset the avatar's hunger level and return the emoji to its default happy state.

#Features
- Avatar that displays 2 emotions: smile and frown
